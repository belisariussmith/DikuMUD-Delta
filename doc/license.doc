                             DikuMud License


As of February 3rd, 2020, the DikuMUD authors Sebastian Hammer, Hans-Henrik
Starfeldt, Katja Nyboe, and Michael Seifert have all agreed to make their
DikuMUD work available under the LGPL license. Weâ€™ve been unable to get a
hold of Tom Madsen, but we feel fairly confident that he would likewise agree
to submit his work under LGPL. This means you can choose yourself if you want
to use DikuMUD under the LGPL or the original license.  Please note that 
derivative work isn't automatically under LGPL. It would need to be 
re-released by its respective authors.

(The original license can be found under the name "license_original.doc" for reference.)
