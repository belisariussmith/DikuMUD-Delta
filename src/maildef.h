// BLOCKSIZE must be greater than NAMESIZE * 2 + LONGSIZE * 2 + CHARSIZE
// 32 is the smallest BLOCKSIZE to use if NAMESIZE == 11, LONGSIZE == 4,
// and CHARSIZE == 1.
//
//    If your players write mostly short mails you may want to have a
//  small blocksize and the other way around. Unfortunately it has not
//      been tested what blocksize would be the most effective so I can't
//      really tell. However I can imagine it'd be somewhere between 70-80
//      and 150 if you're interested in making the mailfile as small as possible.
//      If you're only interested in speed at game reboot and a slight increase
//      in speed when writing/reading/deleting mails you could use a larger
//      blocksize but the mailfile will get bigger. Well if you have the disk
//  space...Try 150-500 bytes/block and see what happens. Remember that
//  if you use a blocksize of 500, no mail will occupy less than 500 bytes.
//  But as I said the optimal setting depends on how large your average
//  mails are and also how much the mailsizes vary.
